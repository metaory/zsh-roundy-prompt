Here's Default Options that currently available to override:

# Note: If your custom symbol overlaps the background or didn't have enough width,
#       you can add space at the end of your defined symbol.
ROUNDY_EXITSTATUS_OK="‚óè"
# You can also using hex code like this
ROUNDY_EXITSTATUS_NO="‚úñ"

# Icon definition for Time Execution
ROUNDY_TEXC_ICON="‚ñ≤"
# ROUNDY_TEXC_ICON="ÔÆ´"

# Minimal time (in ms) for the Time Execution of Command is displayed in prompt
# Set to 0 to disable it
ROUNDY_TEXC_MIN_MS=5

# Overriding username info
ROUNDY_USR_CONTENT_NORMAL=" %n "
ROUNDY_USR_CONTENT_ROOT=" %n "

# ROUNDY_USR_CONTENT_NORMAL='%B%i%b'
# %B for starting bold
# %b for ending bold
# %i for current history event number
# man zshmisc.1

# Working Directory Info Mode

## Colors

By nature of Zsh, colors can be specified using :

- a decimal integer (0-15, or 0-255 if `$TERM` supported)
- alias of the eight colors provided by zsh
- or, as a regular #FFFFFF color hex (if `$TERM` supported, or with the help of `zsh/nearcolor` module)

```sh
# Command Exit Status
ROUNDY_COLORS_BG_EXITSTATUS_OK=4
ROUNDY_COLORS_FG_EXITSTATUS_OK=0

ROUNDY_COLORS_BG_EXITSTATUS_NO=1
